PRODUCER CONSUMER PROBLEM ---> 
The code starts by importing the necessary classes: LinkedList for the buffer, Queue for the interface, Random for generating random data, and Semaphore for synchronization.
The ProducerConsumerExample class is defined with the following constants:

BUFFER_SIZE: The size of the shared buffer (in this case, 5).
DELAY: The maximum delay in milliseconds for simulating the production and consumption of data (in this case, 1000ms or 1 second).
buffer: A LinkedList object representing the shared buffer.
emptySlots: A semaphore initialized with the BUFFER_SIZE, representing the number of empty slots in the buffer.
filledSlots: A semaphore initialized with 0, representing the number of filled slots in the buffer.


The Producer class is defined as an inner static class that implements the Runnable interface. Its run() method contains the following logic:

A Random object is created for generating random data.
An infinite loop is entered.
The thread sleeps for a random duration (up to DELAY milliseconds) to simulate the production of data.
A random data item (integer between 0 and 99) is generated.
The emptySlots semaphore is acquired, ensuring that an empty slot is available in the buffer.
The data item is added (offered) to the buffer using the buffer.offer() method.
A message is printed indicating that the data item has been produced.
The filledSlots semaphore is released, indicating that a new slot is filled in the buffer.


The Consumer class is defined as an inner static class that implements the Runnable interface. Its run() method contains the following logic:

A Random object is created for simulating the consumption of data.
An infinite loop is entered.
The thread sleeps for a random duration (up to DELAY milliseconds) to simulate the consumption of data.
The filledSlots semaphore is acquired, ensuring that a filled slot is available in the buffer.
A data item is removed (polled) from the buffer using the buffer.poll() method.
A message is printed indicating that the data item has been consumed.
The emptySlots semaphore is released, indicating that a new slot is now empty in the buffer.


In the main method, two threads are created: one for the Producer and one for the Consumer.

An instance of the Producer class is created and wrapped in a Thread object.
An instance of the Consumer class is created and wrapped in a Thread object.
Both threads are started using the start() method.



The purpose of this code is to demonstrate the Producer-Consumer problem, where producers generate data items and add them to a shared buffer, while consumers take data items from the buffer and consume them. The semaphores emptySlots and filledSlots are used to synchronize access to the shared buffer and ensure that producers don't attempt to add data to a full buffer, and consumers don't attempt to take data from an empty buffer.
The emptySlots semaphore is initialized with the BUFFER_SIZE, indicating that all slots in the buffer are initially empty. When a producer wants to add data to the buffer, it acquires an emptySlots semaphore, ensuring that there is an empty slot available. After adding the data, it releases a filledSlots semaphore, indicating that a new slot is now filled.
Similarly, when a consumer wants to take data from the buffer, it acquires a filledSlots semaphore, ensuring that there is a filled slot available. After taking the data, it releases an emptySlots semaphore, indicating that a new slot is now empty.
This implementation ensures that producers and consumers can safely access the shared buffer without any race conditions or data corruption.







READER WRITER PROBLEM EXPLAINATION --->
Sure, let's go through the code step by step:

The code starts by importing the java.util.concurrent.Semaphore class, which provides a simple way to implement semaphores in Java.
The ReaderWriterExample class is defined, which contains the following members:

data: An integer variable representing the shared resource that readers will read and writers will modify.
readCount: An integer variable to keep track of the number of active readers.
mutex: A binary semaphore used for mutual exclusion when updating the readCount variable.
wrt: A binary semaphore used for controlling read/write access to the shared resource.


The Reader class is defined as an inner class of ReaderWriterExample. It implements the Runnable interface, which means it can be executed as a separate thread. The run() method contains the following logic:

The reader thread enters an infinite loop.
The mutex semaphore is acquired to update the readCount variable safely.
The readCount is incremented, and if it's the first reader, the wrt semaphore is acquired to prevent writers from accessing the shared resource.
The mutex semaphore is released.
The reader thread reads the shared data data and prints a message.
The mutex semaphore is acquired again to update the readCount variable.
The readCount is decremented, and if it's the last reader, the wrt semaphore is released, and any waiting writers are notified.
The mutex semaphore is released.
The reader thread sleeps for 1 second to simulate a reading operation.


The Writer class is defined as an inner class of ReaderWriterExample. It implements the Runnable interface, which means it can be executed as a separate thread. The run() method contains the following logic:

The writer thread enters an infinite loop.
The wrt semaphore is acquired to ensure exclusive access to the shared resource.
If there are active readers (readCount > 0), the writer thread waits on the wrt semaphore until all readers have finished.
The writer thread modifies the shared data data by incrementing it and prints a message.
The wrt semaphore is released, allowing readers or other writers to access the shared resource.
The writer thread sleeps for 2 seconds to simulate a writing operation.


In the main method, an instance of the ReaderWriterExample class is created.
Two reader threads (reader1 and reader2) and one writer thread (writer) are created using the Thread class and the inner classes Reader and Writer.
The reader and writer threads are started using the start() method.

The purpose of this code is to demonstrate the Reader-Writer problem, where multiple reader threads can read the shared data concurrently, but only one writer thread can modify the shared data at a time. The semaphores mutex and wrt are used to ensure proper synchronization and mutual exclusion between readers and writers.
When a reader thread wants to read the shared data, it acquires the wrt semaphore to ensure no writers are currently modifying the data. It also acquires the mutex semaphore to safely increment the readCount. If it's the first reader, it acquires the wrt semaphore again to prevent writers from accessing the shared resource.
When a writer thread wants to modify the shared data, it acquires the wrt semaphore to ensure exclusive access. If there are active readers (readCount > 0), the writer thread waits on the wrt semaphore until all readers have finished.
After reading or writing the shared data, the reader and writer threads release the acquired semaphores, allowing other threads to access the shared resource.
